# ES6 Classes

Welcome to the world of ES6 classes, where we level up our JavaScript game by organizing our code into neat, reusable structures. In this README, we'll cover everything from defining classes to extending them and even dabbling in metaprogramming and symbols. Let's get started!

## How to Define a Class

Defining a class in ES6 is as easy as pie. It provides a clean syntax for creating object blueprints. Here's how we do it:

```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(brand) {
    this.brand = brand;
  }

  drive() {
    console.log(`Vroom! ${this.brand} is zooming ahead!`);
  }
}
```

In this example, we define a `Car` class with a constructor to initialize its `brand` property and a `drive` method to make it zoom.

## How to Add Methods to a Class

Adding methods to a class is a breeze. We simply define them within the class block like so:

```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(brand) {
    this.brand = brand;
  }

  drive() {
    console.log(`Vroom! ${this.brand} is zooming ahead!`);
  }

  honk() {
    console.log(`Beep beep! ${this.brand} says hi!`);
  }
}
```

Now our `Car` class can both drive and honk.

## Why and How to Add a Static Method to a Class

Static methods are handy when we want functionality that belongs to the class itself rather than instances of the class. Here's how we add a static method:

```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(brand) {
    this.brand = brand;
  }

  drive() {
    console.log(`Vroom! ${this.brand} is zooming ahead!`);
  }

  static info() {
    console.log('Cars are awesome!');
  }
}
```

Now, we can call the `info` method directly on the `Car` class itself, like `Car.info()`.

## How to Extend a Class from Another

Inheritance allows us to create a new class based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods. Here's how it's done:

```javascript
class ElectricCar extends Car {
  charge() {
    console.log(`${this.brand} is charging up!`);
  }
}
```

Now, `ElectricCar` inherits the `drive` method from `Car` and adds its own `charge` method.

## Metaprogramming and Symbols

Metaprogramming is like programming at a higher level, where we can dynamically manipulate the behavior of our code. Symbols are unique identifiers that can be used as property keys. Here's a taste of how they can be used:

```javascript
const secretKey = Symbol('secret');

class Locker {
  constructor() {
    this[secretKey] = 'treasure';
  }

  getSecret() {
    return this[secretKey];
  }
}
```

In this example, `secretKey` is a symbol that's used as a property key to hide the treasure inside the `Locker` class.

And there we have it! A comprehensive README on ES6 Classes. Now go forth, my friend, and wield the power of classes in our JavaScript adventures! ðŸš€
