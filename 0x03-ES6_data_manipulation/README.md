## ES6 Data Manipulation

Welcome to the exciting realm of ES6 data manipulation! In this README, we'll explore some powerful tools and techniques for working with data in JavaScript.

### 1. Using map, filter, and reduce on arrays

#### Map
The `map` function in JavaScript allows us to transform each element of an array according to a specified callback function. It creates a new array with the results of calling the provided function on every element in the array.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Double each number in the array
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(num => num * 2);

console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

#### Filter
The `filter` function, as the name suggests, creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Filter out odd numbers
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4]
```

#### Reduce
The `reduce` function applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Sum all numbers in the array
const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue, 0);

console.log(sum); // Output: 15
```

### 2. Typed arrays

Typed arrays provide a low-level interface to binary data in memory. Unlike regular arrays, which can store various data types, typed arrays are designed to store a specific data type. This specialization allows for more efficient manipulation and processing of large datasets, especially when dealing with numerical data. They are different from regular arrays in that they store data in a fixed memory buffer of a specific type, such as integers or floats.

Here are some key points about typed arrays:

- **Memory efficiency**: Typed arrays are more memory-efficient compared to regular arrays because they store data in a contiguous block of memory, which reduces memory overhead.

- **Performance**: Due to their low-level nature, typed arrays offer better performance for tasks such as numerical computations and data manipulation.

- **Data types**: Typed arrays support various data types, including integers (Int8Array, Uint8Array, Int16Array, Uint16Array, Int32Array, Uint32Array), floats (Float32Array, Float64Array), and even raw binary data (DataView).

- **Interoperability with WebGL and WebAssembly**: Typed arrays are commonly used in conjunction with WebGL and WebAssembly for high-performance graphics rendering and numerical computations.

- **Endianness**: Typed arrays allow you to specify the byte order (endianness) of the data, which is crucial for interoperability with binary data formats.

```javascript
// Create a 32-bit integer typed array with 4 elements
const intArray = new Int32Array([1, 2, 3, 4]);

console.log(intArray); // Output: Int32Array [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### 3. Set, Map, and WeakMap data structures

#### Set
A `Set` is a collection of unique values, meaning any duplicate values are automatically removed.

```javascript
const uniqueNumbers = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]);

console.log(uniqueNumbers); // Output: Set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

#### Map
A `Map` is a collection of key-value pairs where each key can be of any type.

```javascript
const userRoles = new Map();

userRoles.set('John', 'Admin');
userRoles.set('Jane', 'Editor');

console.log(userRoles.get('John')); // Output: Admin
```

#### WeakMap
A `WeakMap` is similar to a Map, but the keys must be objects and are weakly referenced, meaning they do not prevent garbage collection. This means that if the only reference to the key is within the WeakMap, the key may be garbage collected and the corresponding entry in the WeakMap will be automatically removed.

```javascript
let key = { id: 1 };
const weakMap = new WeakMap();
weakMap.set(key, 'value');

console.log(weakMap.get(key)); // Output: value
key = null; // key can now be garbage collected
```

### Conclusion

By mastering techniques like map, filter, and reduce, and gaining a deeper understanding of typed arrays and JavaScript collections, we will equip ourselves with powerful tools for manipulating data in JavaScript.
